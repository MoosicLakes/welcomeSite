     <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Moosic Lakes!</h1>
     <p>
       Moosic Lakes is a private community situated atop picturesque Moosic Mountain in Northeastern Pennsylvania.
       It is the highest elevation in Lackawanna County, at 2,323 feet, and consists of two spring-fed lakes surrounded by beautiful woodlands and natural scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time, Moosic Lakes was also known as “Moosic Lake Amusements”, a park that opened at the beginning of the 1900's. This park, which closed in 1925, was home to a merry-go-round, roller coaster, and dance pavilion, in addition to other rides and concessions.
      Famous entertainers would also perform here. The pavilion, which housed a dining room with stage, remained standing until it burned in 1962. The mountain was also home to a popular boys camp for many years under the sponsorship of the Bishop of Scranton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Development of Moosic Lakes property for public sale began in 1938, and the Moosic Lakes Club (MLC) was established in 1942. Membership in the MLC is required of all property owners.
      Because this is a private community, all road and facilities upkeep, snow removal, insurance, etc. are financed solely on annual invoiced dues and assessments as needed. Dues, donations, grants, and assessments also allow for environmental
      studies and other projects intended for the preservation of the lakes and surrounding properties. For instance, the community was able to construct a new Community Center and enhance the main beach area.
    </p>
    <p>
       Moosic Lakes is now home to over 200 year-round and seasonal residents. And more than one-half of those MLC members responding to a 2006 survey revealed that they have lived at Moosic Lakes for over 30 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is a means of providing a variety of information to all residents and property owners with online access. It is not intended as a replacement for any other current methods of community correspondence.
      It is also our hope that all members who access this site will:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gain a greater understanding of the importance of maintaining the quality of our lakes and preserving our woodlands and
        </li>
        <li>
          Become more involved by volunteering to assist in the continued health and beauty of Moosic Lakes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Beach and Community Center

    <p>
      Our enhanced main beach area and Community Center (constructed in 2005-06) offer a variety of beachside services and functions for MLC members in good standing and their guests.
      In addition to enjoying all the daily amenities offered for a summer day at the beach, the Community Center is also available year-round for private event/activity rental (for members in good standing only).

      The Center's large recreation room can be used for multiple functions, e.g., birthdays, graduation, meetings, etc. In addition to 100 chairs, eight 8' and four 6' tables are available for use.
       Also, twelve rocking chairs have been added to the porch area of the Center, offering a beautiful and relaxing way to enjoy the Big Lake.
